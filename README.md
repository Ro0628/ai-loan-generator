# 🔥 AI Loan Generator

## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI Loan Generator** is an artificial intelligent tool designed to streamline and automate the creation of test loan data within a **Loan Origination System (LOS)**. It leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate structured loan applications based on natural language prompts. 

This tool **reduces manual data entry, improves test efficiency, and enhances loan validation processes** by ensuring diverse and dynamic loan datasets are created for testing and development.

## 🏢 Business Problem
### **Challenges in Loan Origination System Testing**
Loan Origination Systems (LOS) require **comprehensive testing** across various loan scenarios, but the process is often:
- **Time-consuming** – Manual data entry slows down testing.
- **Error-prone** – Inconsistent data can lead to unreliable test results.
- **Lacking diversity** – Test cases often don’t cover enough edge cases.
- **Difficult to scale** – Generating thousands of test loans is tedious.

As a result, **financial institutions, QA teams, and developers struggle to validate their LOS effectively**.

## ✅ Solution: AI Loan Generator
This AI-powered tool **automates test loan creation** by allowing users to generate loan data with simple natural language prompts such as:

> *"Create a VA 30-year loan for one borrower in Houston, TX, priced at $400K, currently in underwriting."*

### **How This Project Solves the Problem**
✔ **Automates Loan Data Generation** – Eliminates manual test loan creation.  
✔ **Improves Test Coverage** – Generates diverse test cases, covering multiple loan types and borrower scenarios.  
✔ **Enhances Accuracy** – Reduces human errors in data entry.  
✔ **Scales Easily** – Can generate thousands of structured test loans quickly.  
✔ **Seamless API Integration** – Pushes generated loan data directly to LOS tables.
